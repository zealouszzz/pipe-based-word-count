# pipe-based-word-count
This project aims at providing you with an opportunity to design and implement a C program, where two processes are coorperating through Unix Pipes.   
In this project, we focus on ordinary pipes that enable two processes to communicate in a producer-consumer fashion.   
In other words, a producer process writes to one end of a piple (i.e., write-end) and a consumer process reads from the other end (i.e., read-end).
